SELECT ID AS IDNumber, Last Name, First Name, City
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = ' ';

you will see an empty rseult because no row in Employees
has some empty character inside the column Department

the correct query is:
SELECT ID AS IDNumber, Last Name, First Name, City
FROM Employees
WHERE Department IS NULL;
