BETWEEN
it controls if a values is included in a specific interval (including the extremes)

WHERE Wage BETWEEN 30000 AND 34000

this is better than writing
Wage>= 30000 AND Wage<=45000


________________
IN
it controls if a value belongs to one of the values of a list specified after the word 'in'

WHERE City IN ('London', 'Manchester', 'Oxford')

which is better than typing:
City = 'London' OR City = 'Manchester' OR City = 'Oxford'

____________________
LIKE
it allows to use some sort of wildcards:

LIKE 'ab%' allows to find all strings that starts with the characters 'ab..'
LIKE '%ab%' allows to find all strings that contain 'ab'

SELECT Last_Name, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Last_Name LIKE 'R%';

this means select the last name and the department from the table Employees where the
last name starts with 'R..''

if you need to find the character '_'  you have to use 'ESCAPE'

LIKE '%$_%' ESCAPE '$'
the character $ is the escape character, therefore the sequence '$_'
says that the character _ (underline) is the character to find in
the string and not a jolly character

____________________
IS NULL

IS NULL compares the value in a column with the value NULL.
The use of this is the only way to control the presence
of the NULL value in a column

SELECT Last_Name, First_Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Wage IS NOT NULL;


For all this operators
