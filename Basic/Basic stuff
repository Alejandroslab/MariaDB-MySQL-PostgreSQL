FIRST: It is not necessary to write commands in capital letters

SQL works with databases and tables.
Databases contain tables.


Before starting manipulating tables you need to SPEFICY WHICH DATABSE YOU WANT TO USE:
To do that you must use this command:


USE mydatabase;


When you select a database to be used you will see
that is empty if it hase been just created.
therefore you need to create tables to populate it.



After launhcin USE mydatabase you can use show tables to show the tables:

SHOW TABLES;



to see the structure of a table you use the command DESCRIBE

DESCRIBE mytable;
you will get the names and characteristics of each field in
the tables

you can get the same with SHOW COLUMNS:

SHOW COLUMNS FROM mytable;
